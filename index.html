        <h2>Introduction to APIs</h2>
        <h3>What is an API?</h3>
        <p>
          An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and
          protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It
          allows different software systems to communicate with each other.

      <!-- Slide 2: Common Examples of APIs -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h3>Common Examples of APIs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Web APIs</strong>: Interfaces for interacting with web
            services. For example, the Twitter API allows applications to access
            public tweets and post new ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operating System APIs</strong>: Allow applications to
            perform functions like creating files, sending output to the
            display, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database APIs</strong>: Enable communication between an
            application and a database management system.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 3: Importance of APIs -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h3>Importance of APIs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration</strong>: APIs allow different software systems
            to work together, facilitating integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automation</strong>: They enable automation of tasks by
            allowing software systems to interact programmatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extension and Scalability</strong>: APIs provide a way for
            extending the functionality of existing products and services.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Slide 4: Understanding RESTful APIs and HTTP Methods -->

      <!-- Slide 5: What are RESTful APIs? -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide5">
        <h3>What are RESTful APIs?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>REST (Representational State Transfer)</strong>: An
          architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs
          use HTTP requests to access and use data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Stateless</strong>: Each HTTP request from a client to server
          must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the
          request.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 6: HTTP Methods -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide6">
        <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>GET</strong>: Used to retrieve data from a server at the
            specified resource. For example, requesting a user's data from an
            API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>POST</strong>: Used to send data to a server to
            create/update a resource. For example, posting a tweet via the
            Twitter API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PUT</strong>: Used to update an existing resource on the
            server. Typically, it provides a complete update.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DELETE</strong>: Removes the specified resource from the
            server.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 7: What is JSON? -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide7">
        <h3>What is JSON?</h3>
        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
          format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines
          to parse and generate. JSON is built on two structures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A collection of name/value pairs (often called an object in
            programming languages).
          </li>
          <li>An ordered list of values (often called an array).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- Slide 8: Example of JSON -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide8">
        <h3>Example of JSON</h3>
        <p>Here's a simple example of JSON data representing a person:</p>
        <pre id="jsonExample">
    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30,
        "isEmployed": true,
        "address": {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Anytown",
            "zipcode": "12345"
        },
        "phoneNumbers": ["123-456-7890", "456-789-0123"]
    }

      <!-- Slide 9: Why We Use JSON -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide9">
        <h3>Why We Use JSON</h3>
        <p>JSON is widely used in web applications for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Interchange</strong>: It is a standard format for
            sending and receiving data through APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Configurations</strong>: Many applications use JSON for
            configuration files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage</strong>: JSON is used in databases like MongoDB to
            store structured data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- Slide 10: HTTP Status Codes Overview -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide10">
        <h3>HTTP Status Codes Overview</h3>
        <p>
          HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by the server to
          indicate the status of a client's request. They are grouped into five
          classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1xx (Informational)</strong>: These codes indicate a
            provisional response, primarily to acknowledge that the request was
            received.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2xx (Success)</strong>: These codes indicate that the
            client's request was successfully received, understood, and
            accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3xx (Redirection)</strong>: These codes indicate that
            further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the
            request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4xx (Client Error)</strong>: These codes indicate an error
            that the client made (e.g., a bad request or unauthorized access).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5xx (Server Error)</strong>: These codes indicate an error
            on the server's side (e.g., the server failed to fulfill a valid
            request).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- Slide 11: Common HTTP Status Codes -->
      <div class="slide" id="slide11">
        <h3>Common HTTP Status Codes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>200 OK</strong>: The request has succeeded. The meaning of
            the success depends on the HTTP method used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>: This response code means
            that the URI of the requested resource has been changed permanently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The server can't find the requested
            resource. This code is often used when the server does not wish to
            reveal exactly why the request has been refused.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: A generic error message,
            given when no more specific message is suitable.
          </li>
